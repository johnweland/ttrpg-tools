# Companion Discord Bot

## Overview

The **Companion Discord Bot** is a centralized, standalone Discord bot designed to enhance the tabletop RPG experience by integrating with both the **TTRPG Scheduling Tool** and **Session Notes Tool**. Acting as a powerful assistant for Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players alike, the bot provides an intuitive interface to manage group scheduling, track session summaries, and coordinate gameplay activities directly within Discord.

Through simple commands and conversational prompts, the bot streamlines the process of organizing sessions, updating notes, and managing availability, leaving players free to focus on gameplay.

## Key Features

- **Scheduling Integration**: Enables players to check and update availability, view group schedules, and confirm upcoming sessions. The bot listens for scheduling discussions, suggests times, and manages conflicts across multiple groups, with final confirmation by the DM or designated assistant.

- **Session Notes Integration**: Allows DMs or designated users to log session notes, create summaries, and link to past sessions. The bot can automatically capture important highlights and help retrieve previous notes, ensuring game continuity.

- **Centralized Command System**: Commands for scheduling, availability, and session notes are all accessible from within Discord, creating a unified experience for managing TTRPG activities.

## Use Case

The TTRPG Companion Bot is ideal for TTRPG groups that:

1. **Manage Multiple Sessions**: The bot’s integration with a calendar tool allows DMs and players to organize schedules across multiple groups, preventing scheduling conflicts and keeping everyone on the same page.

2. **Need Session Recaps and Record-Keeping**: The bot’s notes integration provides a simple way to log session details, retrieve summaries, and track in-game events, ensuring continuity between sessions.

3. **Prefer a Centralized TTRPG Assistant**: By integrating with both the scheduling and notes tools, the bot acts as a one-stop shop for organizing all aspects of a TTRPG campaign, making it easier for groups to stay organized and connected.
