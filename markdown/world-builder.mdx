# World Builder

### Overview
Welcome to **World Builder** – a next-generation digital tool designed to revolutionize tabletop role-playing games by making world-building and immersive storytelling more accessible, interconnected, and dynamic. With **World Builder**, Dungeon Masters (DMs) and Game Masters (GMs) can craft intricate worlds and narratives, managing every detail from vast historical events to the most memorable NPCs. Players can interact with these worlds, uncovering lore, tracking their character's discoveries, and staying immersed in rich narratives designed by their DM.

### Vision
Our goal is to create a tool that brings the magic of role-playing worlds to life by combining advanced organizational features with ease of access. **World Builder** is inspired by the storytelling power of tools like Scabard and World Anvil, but with a modern approach that emphasizes group interaction, progressive storytelling, and fully customized, player-specific experiences.

### Key Features

1. **World Creation**
   - Create worlds with interconnected notes representing **people, places, items, events**, and more.
   - Link notes together intuitively (e.g., "A tavern owner who once belonged to the [[guild]] now runs the tavern in [[town]].") for a cohesive narrative experience.
   - For players involved in multiple campaigns, navigate between worlds and groups seamlessly.

2. **Interactive and Customizable Notes**
   - **WYSIWYG editor with Markdown and drag-and-drop**: Users can create complex notes with multimedia, linking to other notes, and formatting details.
   - **Visibility controls**: DMs can mark information within notes as visible, private, or hidden, gradually revealing more as players make in-game discoveries.

3. **Advanced Visualization Tools**
   - **Timelines** for historical events and epochs that scroll or zoom, revealing the world’s history.
   - **Organization Charts** for groups like guilds or royal courts, with roles and relationships that can be partially revealed.
   - **Family Trees** to outline relationships within noble families, important NPC lineages, or even supernatural bloodlines.

4. **Progressive Discovery Mechanism**
   - Selective visibility enables DMs to reveal secrets as players uncover them, providing clues, plot twists, and background lore over time.
   - Keep suspense high with a layered approach, so players uncover mysteries piece by piece.

5. **Account Notifications & Grouping**
   - Players receive account notifications when new information is shared in worlds they are part of.
   - Customizable notification settings let players adjust update frequency and organize notifications by world.
   - **Multi-world compatibility** for players and DMs involved in more than one game at a time.

6. **Export Options**
   - For reference, notes can be exported as PDFs, but our main goal is for **World Builder** to serve as an online, real-time reference tool, delivering information in context as it’s needed.
